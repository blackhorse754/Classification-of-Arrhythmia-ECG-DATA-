# Classification-of-Arrhythmia-ECG-DATA
    * Analyzed a dataset comprising 452 instances across 16 classes, with 245 cases representing individuals without arrhythmias ("normal").
    + Explored 12 distinct arrhythmia types, emphasizing the significance of "coronary artery disease" and "Rjgbt bundle branch block."
    + Leveraged a dataset encompassing 279 features, including patient age, sex, weight, height, and other relevant information.
    + Acknowledged the challenge of a relatively high feature-to-example ratio, highlighting the need for sophisticated predictive modeling.
    + Developed a predictive model to assess the presence of arrhythmia in individuals, aiming to classify cases into one of the 12 specific arrhythmia groups.
